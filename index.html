    <h1>An Interactive Guide to the Wonderful World of Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>I gave myself the challenge to learn as much as I could about neural networks within a week. I've noitced process of understanding it could be easy and you could learn what I learned within one to two days of what took me a week, while only knowing high school maths.</p>

    <p>During my week I constantly reread <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com">Michael Nielsen's first two chapters</a> and rewatched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&index=2&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi">3Blue1Brown's</a> explanation with the same book as source material. While their explanations are great, there were a few things that made the process a lot longer than it should've been. I hope with this post to be able to make the introduction a bit more gentle by linking some of the mathematical notation they use and by using interactive examples.

    <h2>So what are artificial neural networks?</h2>
    <p>A machine learning model that is loosely inspired on the real thing -- a biological brain. Researchers
    were trying to mathematically model the brain back in the sixties. Instead of recreating
    an organism-like brain, they created a new technique to classify cats or dogs!</p>
    <aside>This is a cat. Most trained neural networks agree.<img src="cat.jpg" width="100" height="67" alt="Photo by Mikhail Vasilyev on Unsplash"></aside>
    <p>So like the real thing, the artificial version has:
      <ol>
        <li>neurons (visualized here as circles, except purple ones) and</li>
        <li>axons (visualized here as lines)</li>
      </ol>

    <p>And they are used to predict stuff! Such as whether there is a cat in a picture.</p>

    <p>A <em>trained</em> artificial neural network does this well and an untrained one does
      this not well at all. So in order to know what artificial neural networks are, one really
      needs to know how it (1) predicts and (2) how it is trained.</p>

    <p>Training an artifical neural network is mathematically speaking the harder part. For now
    we will start with the easier part: how does a neural network predict something?</p>

    <h2>Showing how a neural network predicts by modeling them as logic gates</h2>
    <p>Let's look at the smallest and simplest neural network possible. We are going to use raw values (non-normalized values) to make it even simpler. We'll tack on complexity as we go.</p>

    <p>The smallest network possible has two layers: one input layer and one output layer. The input layer contains 1 neuron (blue circle) and 1 bias (purple circle, a bias is not a neuron). The output layer contains 1 neuron (green circle).</p>

    <p>This architecture is able to model a NOT gate. And you are going to train this network to become a NOT gate. As you can see now the output neuron outputs a 2. It is your goal for it to output a -1 (the number in the green circle) when the input is 1 (the number in the blue circle) and when the input is 1 to output -1. The idea is to play with all the sliders to see what happens and to find the right values.</p>
    <aside>A NOT gate is a gate which takes one bit as input and flips it. So a 0 becomes a 1 and a 1 becomes a 0. <img width="128" height="46" alt="NOT gate schematic from Wikipedia" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Not-gate-en.svg/1920px-Not-gate-en.svg.png">

        <div id="simplest-ann-output-layer">Output Layer</div>
    </div>

    <p>Did you get it? What values did you use? Do you know what process is happening for it to produce a -1 or +1?</p>
  
    <p>The two big sliders are determining the value of the circles. The blue circle
    is called the <strong>input neuron \(x\)</strong>. The purple circle is called a <strong>bias \(b\)</strong>. Per layer there
    can be multiple neurons and only one bias. And in our little world, biases are
    always purple. The input neuron \(x\) has a corresponding <strong>weight \(w_x\)</strong> and the bias \(b\) has the corresponding weight <span class="nowrap">\(w_b\).</span></p>
    <p>As you can see, mathematically what happens is that: the green output neuron \(y\) is governed by the following equation: 
      $$y = w_{x}x + w_{b}b$$
    My slider values were: set \(w_x = -1\), \(b = 0\) for \(y = 1\).</p>

    <p>At this point in time neurons and biases seem the same. That is because the simplest neural
    network that I can think of does not do anything special with the neurons. An already noticable
    difference is that the weight of the bias has to be 1, only the bias value itself can change. Because
    of this \(y\) can be simplified to:
    $$ y = w_{x}x + b $$
    </p>

    <aside>Most visualizations that I encountered, biases aren't visualized. The traditional notation for a bias is not split up in \(w_b\) and \(b\) since the value of the bias being 1 was always implicit. So whether \(w_b\) is a variable or \(b\) is a variable, it really depends on the perspective. The traditional notation, however, favors \(b\) which is why I chose for that as well.</aside>

    <p>Biases are meant to indicate whether a layer of neurons is easily excitable. Meaning that when the value of the bias gets higher, the value of the output layer will be higher as well. They act as a certain threshold as well when the value of the bias gets lower. You can test it for yourself.</p> 

    <p>Most neurons get a special treatment. You want to know what special treatment? I am glad you ask! Currently our values are not normalized between 0 and 1 (or between -1 and 1, pick whatever
    you find normal). We're going to normalize it between 0 and 1 with a special mathematical function called an activation function. By doing so we can have many more different weights in order to create our logic NOT gate.</p>
    
    <h2>Activation functions</h2>
    <!-- Rewrite -->
    <p>Activation functions are slightly analogous to action potentials that real neurons have. That is
    either a neuron fires, or it doesn't. This analogy has later been abandoned but the sigmoid function is quite suited for it. needed to exceed a certain threshold. Another reason alluded to earlier is data normalization. There are many types of activation function, and the one that we are going to use is called the sigmoid function, also known as $$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$ where: $$z = w_{x}x + b$$ Thus: $$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(w_{x}x + b)}}$$
    It looks like this: you can play with w and b.</p>

        let b = document.getElementById('b')
        wx.addEventListener('input', () => {
          document.getElementById('wx-out').innerHTML = wx.value
        })
        b.addEventListener('input', () => {
          document.getElementById('b-out').innerHTML = b.value
        })
      }
      initSliders();
    </script>

    <p>
      We were already familiar with the equation \(z = w_{x}x + b\) from previous chapter. The sigmoid function \(delta(z)\) squishes high positive or negative value to a number between 0 and 1. Have you seen what happens when you move \(b\)? It is quite clearly visible that it either acts as a threshhold for activation when \(b\) is negative and acts as an enabler in its activation when \(b\) is positive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's look at the same neural network with this new activation function combined with the graph of the activation function. The sliders of the neural network have an effect on the blue dot on the graph. So you can play with it again and try to get a neural network where you will get an
      inverter again.

    <p>
      This is our first neural network that you trained manually! In this explorable post we
      have seen how we create an inverter through a neural network by playing with the parameters
      of it.
    </p>

    <h2>Code your own neural network inverter</h2>
    We are going to code the feedforward function of our own neural network inverter. We can assume the weights are already trained. The following code can be pasted into the console and you can implement the function yourself.

        <span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">return</span> sig<span style="color:#808030; ">(</span>z<span style="color:#808030; ">)</span>
      <span style="color:#800080; ">}</span>

      feedforward<span style="color:#808030; ">(</span><span style="color:#808030; ">-</span><span style="color:#008c00; ">1</span><span style="color:#808030; ">,</span> <span style="color:#808030; ">-</span><span style="color:#008c00; ">10</span><span style="color:#808030; ">,</span> <span style="color:#008c00; ">0</span><span style="color:#808030; ">)</span>
    </pre>

    The goal is to implement the z variable and the sigmoid function. By doing that you'll have a very humble trained neural network.

    <h2>The next Chapters</h2>

    <p>
      In the next chapter we are going to scale this up for the creation of AND gates, OR gates and XOR gates. We will finish the chapter by looking at a 2 by 2 by 2 neural network. Through this gradual form of scaling it up, matrices will start to appear and we'll see why they are handy (they aren't strictly needed).
    </p>

    <p>After the next chapter we will take a deep dive into why neural networks learn through the combined algorithms called gradient descent and backpropagation. So instead of you manually needing to train it, you can train it automatically!</p>

    <p><strong>To do: or shall I go into backpropagation already with this inverter?</strong></p>
