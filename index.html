    <h1>An Interactive Guide to the Wonderful World of Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>I gave myself the challenge to learn as much as I could about neural networks within a week. I've noitced process of understanding it could be easy and you could learn what I learned within one to two days of what took me a week, while only knowing high school maths.</p>

    <p>During my week I constantly reread <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com">Michael Nielsen's first two chapters</a> and rewatched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&index=2&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi">3Blue1Brown's</a> explanation with the same book as source material. While their explanations are great, there were a few things that made the process a lot longer than it should've been. I hope with this post to be able to make the introduction a bit more gentle by linking some of the mathematical notation they use and by using interactive examples.

    <h2>So what are artificial neural networks?</h2>
    <p>A machine learning model that is loosely inspired on the real thing -- a biological brain. Researchers
    were trying to mathematically model the brain back in the sixties. Instead of recreating
    an organism-like brain, they created a new technique to classify cats or dogs!</p>
    <aside>This is a cat. Most trained neural networks agree.<img src="cat.jpg" width="100" height="67" alt="Photo by Mikhail Vasilyev on Unsplash"></aside>
    <p>So like the real thing, the artificial version has:
      <ol>
        <li>neurons (visualized as circles, except purple ones) and</li>
        <li>axons (visualized as lines)</li>
      </ol>

    <p>And they are used to predict stuff! Such as whether there is a cat in a picture.</p>

    <p>A <em>trained</em> artificial neural network does this well and an untrained one does
      this not well at all. So in order to know what artificial neural networks are, one really
      needs to know how it predicts and how it is trained.</p>

    <p>Training an artifical neural network is mathematically speaking the harder part, but for now
    we will start with the easier part: how does a neural network predict something?</p>

    <h2>Showing how a neural network predicts by modeling them as logic gates</h2>
    <p>Let's look at the smallest and simplest neural network possible. We are going to use raw values (non-normalized values) to make it even simpler. We'll tack on complexity as we go.</p>

    <p>The smallest network possible has two layers: one input layer and one output layer. The input layer contains 1 neuron (blue circle) and 1 bias (purple circle). The output layer contains 1 neuron (green circle).</p>

    <p>This architecture is able to model a NOT gate. And you are going to train this network to become a NOT gate. As you can see now the output neuron outputs a 2. It is your goal for it to output a -1 when the input is 1 and when the input is 1 to output -1. You can play with the sliders and see what happens.</p>
    <aside>A NOT gate is a gate which takes one bit as input and flips it. So a 0 becomes a 1 and a 1 becomes a 0. <img width="128" height="46" alt="NOT gate schematic from Wikipedia" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Not-gate-en.svg/1920px-Not-gate-en.svg.png">

    </div>

    <p>Did you get it? What values did you use? Do you know what process is happening for it to produce a -1 or +1?</p>
  
    <p>The two big sliders are determining the value of the circles. The blue circle
    is called the <strong>input neuron \(x\)</strong>. The purple circle is called a <strong>bias \(b\)</strong>. Per layer there
    can be multiple neurons and only one bias. And in our little world, biases are
    always purple. The input neuron \(x\) has a corresponding <strong>weight \(w_x\)</strong> and the bias \(b\) has the corresponding weight <span class="nowrap">\(w_b\).</span></p>
    <p>As you can see, mathematically what happens is that: the green output neuron \(y\) is governed by the following equation: 
      $$y = w_{x}x + w_{b}b$$
    My slider values were: set \(w_x = -1\), \(b = 0\) for \(y = 1\).</p>

    <p>At this point in time neurons and biases seem the same. That is because the simplest neural
    network that I can think of does not do anything special with the neurons. An already noticable
    difference is that the weight of the bias has to be 1, only the bias value itself can change. Because
    of this \(y\) can be simplified to:
    $$ y = w_{x}x + b $$
    </p>

    <aside>In most visualizations biases aren't visualized. The traditional notation for a bias is not split up in \(w_b\) and \(b\) since the value of the bias being 1 was always implicit. So whether \(w_b\) is a variable or \(b\) is a variable, it really depends on the perspective. The traditional notation, however, favors \(b\) which is why I chose for that.</aside>

    <p>Biases are meant to indicate whether a layer of neurons easily excitable. Meaning that when the value of the bias gets higher, the value of the output layer will be higher as well. They act as a certain threshold as well when the value of the bias gets lower. You can test it for yourself.</p> 

    <p>Most neurons get a special treatment. You want to know what special treatment? I am glad you ask! Currently our values are not normalized between 0 and 1 (or between -1 and 1, pick whatever
    you find normal). We're going to normalize it between 0 and 1 with a special function called
    an activation function. By doing so we can have many more different weights in order to create our logic NOT gate.</p>
    
    <h3>Activation functions</h3>
    <p>Activation functions are slightly analogous to action potentials that real neurons have. That is
    either a neuron fires, or it doesn't. It needed to exceed a certain threshold. This idea has later been relaxed. Another reason alluded to earlier is data normalization. There are many types of activation function, and the one that we are going to use is called the sigmoid function, also known as $$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$ where: $$z = w_{x}x + b$$
    It looks like this: you can play with w and b.</p>

        let wx = document.getElementById('wx')
        let b = document.getElementById('b')
        wx.addEventListener('input', () => {
          document.getElementById('wx-out').innerHTML = 'w: ' + wx.value
        })
        b.addEventListener('input', () => {
          document.getElementById('b-out').innerHTML = 'b: ' + b.value
        })
      }
      initSliders();
    </script>

    <p>
      We were already familiar with the equation \(z = w_{x}x + b\) from previous chapter. The sigmoid function \(delta(z)\) squishes high positive or negative value to a number between 0 and 1. Have you seen what happens when you move \(b\)? It is quite clearly visible that it either acts as a threshhold for activation when \(b\) is negative and acts as an enabler in its activation when \(b\) is positive.

      Let's look at the same neural network with this new activation function.
