    <h1>An Interactive Guide to the Wonderful World of Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>I decided to apply to OpenAI since I was encouraged that
      you don't need a formal background in the field when you
      apply as a machine learning fellow.</p>
    <p>About a week later I got an email back that I applied as
      a machine learning engineer and a Hacker Rank challenge which
      would test my deep fundamental knowledge about backpropagation
      and I needed to complete within a week.</p>
    <p>Wait, one second, did I read that right? Machine learning
      <em>engineer</em>? And within a week I need to have strong
      fundamentals in backpropagation? </p>
    <p>Challenge accepted!</p>
    <p>And, I didn't get in.</p>
    <p>
      Fortunately, I did learn how to create a simple artificial neural
    network and understand the maths behind it. <strong>I think the process of learning it can be easy and you could learn what I learned within one to two days, while only knowing
    high school maths.</strong> High school maths was all I needed and used.</p>

    <h2>So what are artificial neural networks?</h2>
    <p>A machine learning model that is loosely inspired on the real thing. Researchers
    were trying to mathematically model the brain back in the sixties. Instead of recreating
    an organism-like brain, they created a new technique to classify cats or dogs!</p>
    <aside>This is a cat. Most trained neural networks agree.<img src="cat.jpg" width="100" height="67" alt="Photo by Mikhail Vasilyev on Unsplash"></aside>
    <p>So like the real thing, the artificial version has:
      <ol>
        <li>neurons (visualized as circles, except purple ones) and</li>
        <li>axons (visualized as lines)</li>
      </ol>

    <p>And they are used to predict stuff! Such as whether there is a cat in a picture.</p>

    <p>A <em>trained</em> artificial neural network does this well and an untrained one does
      this not well at all. So in order to know what artificial neural networks are, one really
      needs to know how it predicts and how it is trained.</p>

    <p>Training an artifical neural network is mathematically speaking the harder part, but for now
    we will start with the easier part: how does a neural network predict something?</p>

    <h2>How a neural network predicts</h2>
    <p>Let's look at the smallest and simplest neural network possible. You can play with the numbers
    and see what happens. For now, let's assume that everything above 0 is a positive classification and everything below 0 is a negative classification.</p>

      <canvas id="simplest-ann" width=400 height=350></canvas>
        <input type="range" min="-3" max="3" value="1" step="0.25" class="slider" id="simplest-ann-slider-x">
        <input type="range" min="-3" max="3" value="1" step="0.25" class="slider" id="simplest-ann-slider-b">
        <input type="range" min="-3" max="3" value="1" step="0.25" class="slider" id="simplest-ann-slider-wx">
        <!-- <input type="range" min="-3" max="3" value="1" step="0.25" class="slider" id="simplest-ann-slider-wb"> -->
        <div id="simplest-ann-input-layer">Input Layer</div>
        <div id="simplest-ann-output-layer">Output Layer</div>
    </div>
  
    <p>The two big sliders are determining the value of the circles. The blue circle
    is called the <strong>input neuron \(x\)</strong>. The purple circle is called a <strong>bias \(b\)</strong>. Per layer there
    can be multiple neurons and only one bias. And in our little world, biases are
    always purple. The input neuron \(x\) has a corresponding weight \(w_x\) and the bias \(b\) has the corresponding weight \(w_b\).</p>
    <p>As you can see, mathematically what happens is that: the green output neuron \(y\) is governed by the following equation: 
      $$y = w_{x}x + w_{b}b$$
    For example: set \(x = 0.5\), \(w_x = 1.5\), \(b = 2.00\) and \(w_b = 1\). Then \(y = 2.75\).</p>

    <p>At this point in time neurons and biases seem the same. That is because the simplest neural
    network that I can think of does not do anything special with the neurons. An already noticable
    difference is that the weight of bias has to be 1, only the bias value itself can change. Because
    of this \(y\) can be simplified to:
    $$ y = w_{x}x + b $$</p>

    <p>Most neurons get a special treatment. You want to know what special treatment? I am glad you ask! Currently our values are not normalized between 0 and 1 (or between -1 and 1, pick whatever
    you find normal). We're going to normalize it between 0 and 1 with a special function called
    an activation function.</p>
    
    <h3>Activation functions</h3>
    <p>Activation functions are slightly analogous to action potentials that real neurons have. That is
    either a neuron fires, or it doesn't. It needed to exceed a certain threshold. This idea has later been relaxed. Another reason alluded to earlier is data normilization. There are many types of activation function, and the one that we are going to use is called the sigmoid function, also known as $$\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$$ where: $$z = wx + b$$
    It looks like this: you can play with w and b.</p>
