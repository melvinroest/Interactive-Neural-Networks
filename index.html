    <h1>An Interactive Guide to the Wonderful World of Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>I gave myself the challenge to learn as much as I could about neural networks within a week. I've noitced process of understanding it could be easy and you could learn what I learned within one to two days of what took me a week, while only knowing high school maths.</p>

    <aside>Other sources that helped:

      </ol>
    </aside>
    <p>During my week I constantly reread <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com">Michael Nielsen's first two chapters</a> and rewatched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&index=2&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi">3Blue1Brown's</a> explanation with the same book as source material. While their explanations are great, there were a few things that made the process a lot longer than it should've been. I hope with this post to be able to make the introduction a bit more gentle by comparing some of the different mathematical notation they use and by using visualized interactive neural nets!

    <h2>So what are artificial neural networks?</h2>
    <p>A machine learning model that is loosely inspired on the real thing -- a biological brain. Researchers
    were trying to mathematically model the brain back in the sixties. Instead of recreating
    an organism-like brain, they created a new technique to classify cats or dogs!</p>
    <aside>This is a cat. Most trained neural networks agree. Some trained neural networks might even be scared as they can't infer whether this cat is hiding or sneak up on them.<img src="cat.jpg" width="100" height="67" alt="Photo by Mikhail Vasilyev on Unsplash"></aside>
    <p>So like the real thing, the artificial version has:
      <ol>
        <li>neurons</li>
        <li>and axons which link the neurons</li>
      </ol>

    <p>And they are used to predict stuff! Such as whether there is a cat in a picture.</p>

    <p>A <em>trained</em> artificial neural network does this well and an untrained one does
      this not well at all. So in order to know what artificial neural networks are, one really
      needs to know how it (1) predicts and (2) how it is trained.</p>

    <p>Training an artifical neural network is mathematically speaking the harder part. For now
    we will start with the easier part: how does a neural network predict something?</p>

    <h2>Showing how a neural network predicts by modeling them as logic gates</h2>
    <p>Let's look at the smallest and simplest neural network possible. We are going to use raw values (non-normalized values) to make it even simpler. We'll tack on complexity as we go. For now, the idea is to show the whole process with the simplest of simplest 'networks' that I can think of. Once you understand the main ideas behind the most simple network, other things are much easier to understand.</p>

    <p>The smallest network possible has two layers: one input layer and one output layer. The input layer contains 1 neuron and the output layer contains 1 neuron. Try to make the output neuron display a -5. Now try to make the output neuron display a -5 while \(x = 1\)</p>

    <aside>\(a\) stands for <em>activation</em>.</aside>
    <p>This architecture is able to model \(f(x) = wx\), so while it is not very useful, it is very simple to understand. More formally, the two sliders are determining the value of the input neuron \(x\) and the weight \(w\), which is between \(x\) and the output neuron \(a\).
    My slider values were: \(w = -5\) and \(x = 1\).</p>
    
    <h2>Code your own neural super simple neural network</h2>
    We are going to code the feedforward function of our own neural network. 

    <iframe width="100%" height="300" src="https://jsfiddle.net/mettamage/603fwezu/9/embedded/js,result/dark/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowpaymentrequest frameborder="0"></iframe>

    <p>The goal is to implement the return statement in JSFiddle. Look at the model to see what it should be.</p>

    <h2>Automatically training the weights</h2>

    <aside>Later on the idea is for you to put code examples in your developer tools of your Chrome browser.</aside>

    <p>The answer to the previous exercise was: <span style="background:#f1f1f1;"><span style="color:#800000; font-weight:bold; ">return</span> w * x</span>. 

    <p>Let's talk about how this neural network learns things automatically. So far, we trained our small humbe neural network by fumbling around with the parameters ourselves. We played with the weight \(w\) of \(x\). We trained them on one training example: \(x = 1\).</p>

    <p>Before we talk about how neural networks automatically learn through example data, let's quickly look at how I would learn a new accent through imitating another person's accent from a YouTube video. Learning by example!</p>

    <p>
    I listen to how the person I want to imitate is pronouncing the word and then listen to how I am saying it. I then think about what the <em>difference</em> is, adjust the difference as much as I possibly can and then imitate again. When I try to imitate again, the difference between what I am doing and what I'm trying to imitate is hopefully smaller. I iterate on this process as much as possible until I do it good enough.</p>

    <aside>See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBQWZmqb33I">these people learning a British accent through this method</a>! At one point, the difference is not necessarily getting smaller.</aside>

    <p>
    With neural networks, the output neuron has a certain value. That certain value has to match a desired value. By analogy of the previous paragraph, it would make sense that a neural network needs to learn more when that output is nowhere close the desired value compared to when it is quite close.
    </p>

    <p>
      More formally this means that there are three topics that need to be discussed:
      <ol>
        <li>Defining how to calculate the difference between what is desired and whatever the neural network is doing. This is called the loss or <strong>cost function</strong>.</li>
        <li>An algorithm for updating the parameters of the network (in this case only the weight \(w\)) by finding the lowest value for the cost function. This is called <strong>gradient descent</strong></li>.
        <li>A specialized form of gradient descent by constantly applying the chain rule. This is called <strong>backpropagation</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>
      Training a Network: Cost Functions 
      <span class="subtitle">Also known as: knowing how wrong your prediction is</span>
    </h3>

    <p>Let's start with defining the cost function. The difference between the actual output value of a neuron and the desired value is called the error. For example, if the output neuron \(a = 0.2\) and the desired value \(y = 1\), then the error \(e = 0.8 \). Therefore:
    $$ e = (a - y) \textrm{ and } a = wx $$
    </p>

    <strong>Maybe graphical example here?</strong>


    <!-- Maybe put in a network to have an error exercise. -->

    <aside>I will soon explain why we need to calculate partial derivatives, for now, just take it for granted.</aside>

    <p>
      Now that we have the error defined, we can define a cost function. A cost function is simply the same thing as calculating the error, with the difference that it is easy to use for calculating derivatives (this is needed for the gradient descent part). The idea of the cost function is the same as calculating an error: <em>it should give us an indication of how much we're wrong</em>. Because of this, there is no one right formula for defining a cost function. It's a mathematicians playground really, they get to do whatever they want as long as it makes sense for (1) knowing how wrong you are and (2) finding a way to become less wrong. In other words, all formula's are intended to minimize some error that we find important to reduce.

      This means that $$ C = (a - y) $$

      can be seen as a cost function. It is not a very good one however, we need to calculate the partial derivative of it later and therefore a quadratic function will be more informative. Another one I've seen is this one:

      $$ C = (y - a)^2 $$
    </p>

    <aside><a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cute+baby+animals&t=hk&iax=images&ia=images">This always makes my day</a>, it's just too cute! :3</aside>

    <p>
      Intuitively this makes the most sense to look at if we are talking about finding the squared error. However, I prefer the following cost function because the partial derivative is cute and I like cute.

      $$ C = \frac{1}{2} (y - a)^2 $$
    </p>

    <p>This is how the cost function looks graphically for the onlye one training example we have: \(x = 1\). The y-axis is the cost \(C\), the x-axis are possible values for the weight \(w\). The desired value has been set to \(y = -5\) in this graph.</p>

    </canvas>

    <p>From this we can infer that the best weight that matches the desired value as closely as possible is -5 (normally y-values and w-values don't overlap but in this case they're both -5). Woo! It's working! We have an idea of how wrong we are for every weight value for \(w\)!
    </p> 
    <p>
      But how did we see that? Well, we use our eyes and see that \(w = -5\) is simply the lowest point. Computers need to do a similar thing. They somehow need to 'perceive' that \(w = -5\) is the lowest point. One way of doing this is with an algorithm called <em>gradient descent</em>. This is especially handy in a high dimensional space where it is impossible to plot the graph.</p>
    <aside>Gradient descent informally means descending by partial derivative since gradient means partial derivative.</aside>


    <p>
    With having a cost function defined, we can use that function to calculate the error which helps us to automatically adjust the weight! Currently we are able to do that analytically but in a higher dimensional space we can't do this. One way of doing this is by using gradient descent. There are other algorithms, but gradient descent is a basic algorithm used in many machine learning techniques. So the knowledge transfers quite well to other methods.

      Training a Network: Gradient Descent

    </h3>
    <aside>If you want to go downhill, you can also play the game <a href="http://sinerider.com">Sinerider</a>!</aside>
    <p>Derivatives and partial derivatives tell us how a function changes when we give a very gentle nudge in either the positive or negative direction. Consider a parabola \(f(x) = x^2\) as our hypothetical cost function. Then \(f'(x) = 2x\). If you want to go 'downhill', then all you need to do is slowly subtract \(2x\) with a small value repeatedly. This small value is called the learning rate \(\eta\) (pronounced as eta), so finally you'll need to subtract 

    $$2x\eta$$

    $$\textrm{as such: }x \leftarrow x - 2x\eta$$

    Or in programming terms: <br /> <br />

    <div style="text-align: center";><span style="background:#f1f1f1;"><span style="color:#55c">let</span> x<span style="color:#a05050; font-weight:bold; "> = </span> x - 2 * x * eta</span></div>

    </p>

    <p>
      Another way to look at it is:

      $$ x \leftarrow x - f'(x) \eta $$
    </p>

    <aside>I've wondered a for long time as to why this works. In my view: the derivative is the one stop shop answer for the question: what is the <em>fastest change</em> one can make when you have a very small difference for \(x\) such as \(x_1 = 3\) and \(x_2 = 3.0001\)? The answer is: if you can differentiate the function, then the derivative is the fastest change one can make. On your left, you can see this graphically.</aside>

    <p>In the following example this is what we are going to see for the function \(f(x) = x^2\). It will be a very slowed down version of gradient descent. The new function that will be repeatedly recalculated is \(f(x) \leftarrow f(x - 2x\eta)\) and the learning rate \(\eta = 0.01\).</p>

      <strong>Give them a JSFiddle exercise to implement gradient descent. And then state the final paragraph</strong>
    </p>

    <p>So we can just use gradient descent on our previous cost function right? And then we're done! Well, no. It's mathematically a bit more complex because the function isn't as simple as \(x^2\), but if it were as simple as \(x^2\), then yes. Yes, indeed my friend. Unfortunately, that isn't the case. We need to move onward.</p>

      <!-- Aside of Training a Network: Backpropagation -->
      If you don't know what partial derivatives are, they are very alike normal derivatives. The difference is: in a partial derivatives there are multiple variables in an equation, but you treat one variable as an actual variable and pretend that the other variables are constant. For example,
      $$f(x, y) = x^2 + y^3$$

      The partial derivate of f with respect to x is: $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x$$

      The partial derivate of f with respect to y is: $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 3x^2$$

      <br /> <br />

    <h3>
      Training a Network: Backpropagation
      <span class="subtitle">Also known as: constantly applying the chain rule in order to perform gradient descent, but not telling anyone by giving it a fancy name</span>
    </h3>


    <p>
    Fully written the cost function we use is: 

    $$C = \frac{1}{2}(y - a)^2$$
    $$\textrm{for which: } a = wx$$ 
    $$\textrm{such that: } C = \frac{1}{2}(y - wx)^2$$ 

    Which looks alike \(x^2\) because something is squared, but it also has more variables in it with all kinds of meanings such as: \(w\), \(x\) and \(y\).

    We want to find the partial derivative of \(C\) with respect to \(w\). Why with respect to \(w\)? Because that's the weight we want to automatically train!

    To differentiatie this function it needs the chain rule because there are secretly 2 functions in need of differentiation.</p> 


    <p>The first one is the \(\frac{1}{2}(...)^2\) part which is written as the partial derivative of \(C\) with respect to \(a\) which is \(\frac{\partial C}{\partial a}\).
    </p>

    <p>
      The second one is the \(wx\) part which is the partial derivative of \(a\) with respect to \(w\) which is \(\frac{\partial a}{\partial w}\).
    </p>


    <p>
    Combined, it can be written as

    $$\frac{\partial C}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial C}{\partial a}\frac{\partial a}{\partial w}$$

    Let's take a look at both functions and then find the derivative.

    </p>

    <aside style="margin-top: 0;">
      \(\frac{\partial C}{\partial y} = (a - y)\) is an application of the  <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-differentiation-1-new/ab-2-5/v/power-rule">power rule</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-differentiation-2-new/ab-3-1a/v/chain-rule-introduction">chain rule</a> such that you need to differentiate:  

      \(\frac{1}{2}(y - a)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(...)^2  \textrm{ which is } 1*(...)^1 = (...) = (y - a)\textrm{.}\)
      
      \(\textrm{And } y - a \textrm{ which is } {-1} \textrm{ since } {-a} \textrm{ is } {-1} \textrm{ when differentiated.}\)

      Multiplying it as the chain rule states is: \(-1*(y-a) = (-y - a) = (a - y)\)
    </aside>

    <p>

    $$C = \frac{1}{2}(y - a)^2, \textrm{ so }  \frac{\partial C}{\partial a} = (a - y)$$

    $$a = wx, \textrm{ and } \frac{\partial a}{\partial w} = x$$

    $$\frac{\partial C}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial C}{\partial a}\frac{\partial a}{\partial w} = (a - y)x$$
    </p>

    <p>
      And that is what backpropagation is: finding the partial derivative of \(C\) with respect to all the weights in a network (in this case one). This means you have calculated the gradient (partial derivative) for weight \(w\) by using the chain rule and now you can use the rest of the gradient descent algorithm in order to tune the weight. 
    </p>

    <p>Here is a graphical example of our particular network for which we have one training example \(x=1\).</p>

    <p>It is important to note that I have omited many things about neural networks, but this is in essence the nitty gritty overview of how a neural network predicts and trains itself. In the next chapter I will create a network that has an activation function, multiple training examples (2, yes, a 100% increase) and a bias neuron.</p>
